Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. They consist of two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, which compete against each other in a game-theoretic scenario.

Generator: Creates synthetic data samples, attempting to mimic the real data distribution.
Discriminator: Evaluates the authenticity of the samples, distinguishing between real and generated data.
During training, the generator improves its capability to produce realistic data, while the discriminator becomes more skilled at identifying fakes. This adversarial process continues until the generator produces data indistinguishable from the real dataset.
